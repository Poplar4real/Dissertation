This repo for undergraduate dissertation.
## Radar Signal Simulation
Simulation of 12 different kinds of LPI Radar signals using Matlab.
## CNN Classification Using Reciprocal Point Learning(RPL)
Using CNN to classify the TF(Time-Frequency) image of different Radar Signals.  
Choi-Willams Distribution(CWD) is used to analyze the TF of different radar signals.  
To achieve open-set recognition, we introduce a new method called Reciprocal Point Learning.
